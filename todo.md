# Things that need doing

Use CSS boxes to prevent things jumping around so much.

Font does not look good in display of past priorities.

Add an "I did it" button and maybe a brief celebration animation.

Add some emphasis or colour to the top priority, to make it clearly distinguishable.

Store not only previous priorities, but also whether they were completed in a simple table.

Store also date that something was completed in the table.
