# Things that need doing

Fix styling and layout

Clearer distinction between "Today will have been a productive day if:" and the priority itself (e.g. "I built an awesome Chrome extension!")

Stop displaying text in the submission form after it has been submitted

Maybe have a toggle, so that if there's no storedPriority the form displays, but if there's already a storedPriority you just get a button: "Reset or change priority"

Publish the extension, following this guide https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish
